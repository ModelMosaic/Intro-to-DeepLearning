# Introduction to Deep Learning
Welcome to my repository where I document my learnings in several files.

## ðŸ“š Chapters

### 1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
In this foundational chapter, I delved into the basics of neural networks and deep learning, which include:
- Building, training, and applying fully connected deep neural networks.

### 2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization**
This course opened up the "black box" of deep learning, focusing on:
- Techniques like initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, batch normalization, and gradient checking.
- Optimization algorithms including mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam.

### 3. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
Focusing on computer vision applications, this course covered:
- Building and understanding convolutional neural networks.
- Applying these networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
